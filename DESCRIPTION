Description: 
    Implements the Bayesian FDR control described by 
    Newton et al. (2004), <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.155>.
    Allows optimisation and visualisation of expected error rates based on
    tail posterior probability tests.
    Based on code written by Catalina Vallejos for BASiCS, see
    Beyond comparisons of means: understanding changes in gene expression at the
    single-cell level Vallejos et al. (2016) <doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0930-3>.
